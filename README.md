# "Would You Rather?" Project

## Project Overview
This web app lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. 
The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. 
Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In this app, users will be able:
 * to answer questions, 
 * see which questions they haven’t answered, 
 * see how other people have voted, 
 * post questions, 
 * and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.
